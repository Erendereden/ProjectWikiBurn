            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>Bern is located on the Swiss Plateau, in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the country’s center and
                about
                20 km north of the Bernese Alps.</p>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Landscape Formation</h3>
            <p>The surrounding landscape was shaped by glaciers during the last Ice Age.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Nearby hills</h3>
            <p>Two notable hills close to the city are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>the Gurten (858 m),</li>
                <li>the Bantiger (947 m).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Urban topography</h3>
            <p>The city initially developed on a peninsula formed by a meander of the River Aare, which limited its
                natural expansion until the 19th century, when bridges allowed it to spread beyond the river.</p>

            <h3>Altitude differences</h3>
            <p>Bern’s urban terrain is quite irregular: there are altitude differences of several dozen meters between
                districts close to the river (such as Matte and Marzili) and higher ones (Kirchenfeld, Länggasse).</p>
