                        style="float:right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; width:300px; height:auto;">

                    <p>Founded in 1191 by Duke Berthold V of Zähringen, Bern was established as a strategic military
                        outpost. The city's name is believed to be derived from the German word "Bär," meaning bear,
                        which is also reflected in its coat of arms. Over the centuries, Bern grew in importance and
                        became a significant political and economic center in the region.
                        In the 13th century, Bern joined the Swiss Confederation, which helped to solidify its status as
                        a key player in Swiss politics. The city played a crucial role during the Reformation in the
                        16th century, adopting Protestantism and becoming a center for religious and cultural change.

                        Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Bern continued to develop, with significant advancements
                        in infrastructure, education, and governance. The city became the federal city of Switzerland in
                        1848 when the Swiss Constitution was adopted, further cementing its role as the nation's
                        capital.

                        Today, Bern is known for its well-preserved medieval architecture, including the iconic
                        Zytglogge clock tower and the Federal Palace. The city's rich history is celebrated through
                        various museums, cultural events, and historical sites that attract visitors from around the
                        world.</p>

                    <p>Bern (Swiss Standard German: [bɛrn] ), or Berne (French: [bɛʁn] ), is the de facto capital of
                        Switzerland, referred to as the "federal city". With a population of about 146,000 (as of 2024),
                        Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland, behind Zürich, Geneva, Basel and Lausanne.
                        The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014.
                        The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000.
                        Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's
                        cantons. The city’s official language is German. The main spoken language is the local variant
                        of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German. In 1983, the historic old town (in
                        German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is notably
                        surrounded by the Aare, a major river of the Swiss Plateau.
                        Although fortified settlements were established since antiquity, the medieval city proper was
                        founded by the Zähringer ruling family, probably in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen. Bern
                        was made a free imperial city in 1218 and, in 1353, it joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming
                        one of its eight early cantons. Since then, Bern became a large city-state and a prominent actor
                        of Swiss history by pursuing a policy of sovereign territorial expansion. Since the 15th
                        century, the city was progressively rebuilt and acquired its current characteristics. Bern was
                        made the Federal City in 1848. From about 5,000 inhabitants in the 15th century, the city passed
                        the 100,000 mark in the 1920s\</p\>
                </div>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The etymology of the name "Bern" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk
                    etymology, Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city
                    after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been
                    considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was
                    known as Bern in Middle High German. The city was sometimes referred to as Bern im Üechtland to
                    distinguish it from Verona. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is
                    now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin,
                    possibly \*berna "cleft". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from
                    at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to
                    the 1440s.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p\>No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today's city centre prior to
                    the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel
                    (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La Tène period), thought to
                    be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman
                    vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ("dwelling of Breno"). In the
                    Early Middle Ages, a settlement in Bümpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from
                    the medieval city.
                    The medieval city is a foundation of the Zähringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper
                    Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309),
                    Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen.
                    In 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene
                    Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\</p\>
                </p>
                <h2>old Swiss Confederacy</h2>
                In 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming the eighth canton of the formative period of 1353
                to 1481.
                Bern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories,
                thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps. By the 18th century, it comprised most of
                what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.
                The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The
                Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the Käfigturm took
                over this role until 1345. It was succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located closer to the site
                of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications –
                the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchments) – were built to protect the whole area of the
                peninsula.\</p\>
                <p>After a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by
                    half-timbered houses, and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for
                    the Old Town.
                    Despite waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly
                    due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.
                    During the 18th century, the city of Bern was at one point the largest shareholder in the South Sea
                    Company, a British joint-stock company which was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. From 1689 to
                    3 March 1798 in the town was printed, in French, the biweekly newspaper Gazette de Berne, which
                    reflected the opinions of Bern, usually hostile to the politics of Pre-revolutionary France.</p>
                <h2>Modern history</h2>
                <p>Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped
                    of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the
                    Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became
                    the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of
                    the canton of Jura in 1979.
                    On 28 November 1848, during the revolutions that year, a majority of the new Swiss Federal Assembly
                    deputies chose Bern as the Federal City (seat of the government) of the newly created Swiss federal
                    state, ahead of Zürich and Lucerne. Bern was chosen as not to concentrate all the power in the
                    economic powerhouse of Zürich, while Catholic and conservative Lucerne had been part of the
                    Sonderbund during the war a year before. In addition, Bern had a more central location and was
                    supported by the French-speaking cantons due to proximity to them. However, the constitution doesn't
                    define Bern as official capital of Switzerland, but as the seat of government.
                    A number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern,
                    particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.
                    The city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above
                    60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s. Population peaked during the 1960s at
                    165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000. As of September 2017, the
                    resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident
                    foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.</p>
                <h2>Geography and climate</h2>
                <p>Bern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and
                    20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during
                    the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835
                    ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the
                    point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46°57′08.66″N 7°26′22.50″E.
                    The city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural
                    boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand
                    beyond the Aare.</p>
                <p>Bern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the
                    inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, Länggasse).
                    Bern has an area, as of 2013, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.42 km2 (3.64 sq mi) or
                    18.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.21 km2 (6.64 sq mi) or 33.3% is forested. Of the
                    rest of the land, 23.76 km2 (9.17 sq mi) or 46.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.08 km2 (0.42 sq
                    mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.14 km2 (0.054 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.
                    Of the developed area of Bern, 3.1% consists of industrial buildings, 22.3% housing and other
                    buildings, and 12.9% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well
                    as other special developed areas, made up 1.2% of the city, while another 6.5% consists of parks,
                    green belts, and sports fields.
                    Of Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 13.3% is used for
                    growing crops and 4.4% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the
                    water in the municipality.</p>
                <p>According to the Köppen Climate Classification, Bern has an oceanic climate (Cfb) closely bordering
                    on a humid continental climate (Dfb).
                    The closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5
                    kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean
                    temperature of 18.3 °C (64.9 °F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 °C (75.7 °F). The highest
                    temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F), recorded in August 2003. On average,
                    a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a
                    temperature of 30 °C (86 °F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1
                    °C (89.8 °F).
                    There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of
                    1981–2010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount
